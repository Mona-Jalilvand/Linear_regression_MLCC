# Linear regression MLCC 
Linear regression example from Google Machine Learning Crash Course (https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course)

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates how to build a linear regression model to predict taxi fares based on various features.

## Notebook Structure

* **Data Loading**: Load the taxi fare dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
* **Data Exploration**: Analyze the dataset's characteristics, including shape, data types, and summary statistics.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for modeling, such as handling missing values and outliers.
* **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
* **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model using **Keras library**
* **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's accuracy using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared.
* **Predictions**: Make predictions on new data using the trained model.
